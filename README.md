<h1 align="center">🌈 Dreaming of a future where everyone walks with their own AI 🌈</h1>

<p align="center">
  I believe that in the near future, having your own AI<br>
  will be as natural as carrying a smartphone.<br><br>
  More than just a tool, AI will be a trusted companion —<br>
  someone to learn with, to share life with,<br>
  and to support each other along the journey.
